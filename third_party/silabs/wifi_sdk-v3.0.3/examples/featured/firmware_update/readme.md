# Firmware Update

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to update the SiWx91x firmware via Wi-Fi by downloading an image from a remote TCP server. The TCP server may be hosted on a local PC (as demonstrated in this example), or alternately on a cloud service such as Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure. The update process works as follows:
  - The SiWx91x connects via Wi-Fi as a TCP client to a TCP update server
  - The SiWx91x OTA application sends a firmware file request to the server and server responds with the firmware file
  - The OTA application programs the firmware into the SiWx91x flash memory and reboots

### 3.2 Set up for application prints

#### 3.2.1 SoC mode

  You can use either of the below USB to UART converters for application prints.

1. Set up using USB to UART converter board.

  	- Connect Tx (Pin-6) to P27 on WSTK
  	- Connect GND (Pin 8 or 10) to GND on WSTK

    **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_1.png)**

2. Set up using USB to UART converter cable.

  	- Connect RX (Pin 5) of TTL convertor to P27 on WSTK
  	- Connect GND (Pin1) of TTL convertor to GND on WSTK

    **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_2.png)**

## 4 Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. 
### TCP Configuration

```c
#define SERVER_PORT        5001        // TCP server port of the remote TCP server
#define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS  "172.20.10.3"  // Server IP address 
```

### 4.2 Build the application

-	SoC mode: Build as Firmware update Example

    **![Build as](resources/readme/build_firmware_update.png)** 
        
-	NCP mode:

### 4.3 Run and Test the application
## Build and run the TCP Server
  1. Copy the TCP server application [firmware_update_tcp_server.c](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/examples/featured/firmware_update/firmware_update_tcp_server.c) provided with the application source to a Linux PC connected to the Wi-Fi access point. 
  2. Compile the application
> `user@linux:~$ gcc firmware_update_tcp_server.c` -o ota_server.bin
  3. Run the application providing the TCP port number (specified in the SiWx91x app) together with the firmware file and path
> `user@linux:~$ ./ota_server.bin 5001 SiWx91x.NBZ.WC.GEN.OSI.x.x.x.rps`

... where [SiWx91x.NBZ.WC.GEN.OSI.x.x.x.rps](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/firmware) is the firmware image to be sent to SiWx91x.

## Running the Application
After making any custom configuration changes required, build the application.
- Once the build was successful, right click on project and click on Debug As->Silicon Labs ARM Program as shown in below image.

  - SoC

    ![debug_mode_soc](resources/readme/debug_soc.png)

  - NCP

    ![debug_mode_NCP](resources/readme/debugmodencp120.png)


When the application runs and connects to the TCP server, the firmware image transfer occurs in chunks. The app requests a firmware chunk, the server sends the chunk, the app requests the next chunk, the server sends the chunk, and so forth until the entire transfer completes. As the transfer proceeds, progress is printed to the serial console. On completion, the console prints 'reach end of file'.

### 4.4 Application Output

![Figure: Log of firmware transfer](resources/readme/image157.png)

![Figure: Log of firmware transfer](resources/readme/output_soc.png)

When the firmware update completes, the SiWx91x should be rebooted after which it may take a few minutes to overwrite the old firmware with the new firmware in flash memory.
