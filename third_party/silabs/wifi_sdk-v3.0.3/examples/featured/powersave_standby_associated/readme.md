# Powersave Standby Associated

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates the process for configuring the SiWx91x in ASSOCIATED_POWER_SAVE mode, also providing the steps to configure the SiWx91x EVK in station mode and initiate a connection to an Access Point. When the module is in deep sleep, it wakes up in periodic intervals based on DTIM or Listen Interval.

The application connects to a remote server to send UDP data and also enables the analysis of various performance profiles using a power analyzer during the ASSOCIATED_POWER_SAVE with data transfer via UDP.

## 4 Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. 

### 4.1 Configure the application

- `SERVER_PORT` is the remote UDP server port number on the PC running Iperf.
- `SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` is the remote UDP server IP address on the PC running Iperf. 
- `NUMBER_OF_PACKETS` controls the number of packets sent to the remote UDP server.

```c
#define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS   "192.168.0.198"
#define SERVER_PORT         5656
#define NUMBER_OF_PACKETS   1000
```

### 4.2 Build the application

-	SoC mode: Build as Powersave Standby Associated Example

    **![Build as](resources/readme/build_powersave_standby_associated.png)**
    
-	NCP mode: 

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

- Once the build was successful, right click on project and click on Debug As->Silicon Labs ARM Program as shown in below image.

  - SoC

    ![debug_mode_soc](resources/readme/debugmodesoc117.png)

  - NCP

    ![debug_mode_NCP](resources/readme/debugmodencp120.png)

-	Start a UDP server using the below command in command prompt.

> `C:\ iperf.exe –s -u -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1` 

  ![Figure: command prompt on the remote PC](resources/readme/image185.png)

> If the IPerf server does not start and gives an error in the form of "Access Denied", the user can resolve this error by running the command prompt as an administrator.

- When the powersave application runs, SiWx91x scans and connect to the Wi-Fi access point and obtains an IP address. After a successful connection, the device goes into configured power save and sends configured number of UDP packets to the remote peer which is connected to access point. The following image shows active reception of UDP data on the UDP server.
