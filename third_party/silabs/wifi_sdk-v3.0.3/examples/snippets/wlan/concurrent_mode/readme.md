# Concurrent Mode

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure the SiWx91x in concurrent mode i.e., in both Wi-Fi Station mode (STA instance) and Access Point mode (SoftAP instance).
In this example application, the SiWx91x's STA instance gets connected to a wireless Access Point and gets an IP address.

### 3.3 Set up for application prints

**SoC mode**: 
You can use either of the below USB to UART converters for application prints.

1. Set up using USB to UART converter board.

  	- Connect Tx (Pin-6) to P27 on WSTK
  	- Connect GND (Pin 8 or 10) to GND on WSTK

    **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_1.png)**

2. Set up using USB to UART converter cable.

  	- Connect RX (Pin 5) of TTL convertor to P27 on WSTK
  	- Connect GND (Pin1) of TTL convertor to GND on WSTK

    **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_2.png)**

**Tera Term set up - for NCP and SoC modes**

1. Open the Tera Term tool.

	- For SoC mode, choose the serial port to which USB to UART converter is connected and click on **OK**. 
  
	   **![UART - SoC](resources/readme/port_selection_soc.png)**

	- For NCP mode, choose the J-Link port and click on **OK**.

      **![J-link - NCP](resources/readme/port_selection.png)**

2. Navigate to the Setup → Serial port and update the baud rate to **115200** and click on **OK**.

## 4 Application Build Environment

### 4.1 Configure the Application

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

#### 4.1.1 In the Project explorer pane, expand the **resources\defaults** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters based on your requirements.

- **STA instance related parameters**

- WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which the SiWx91x SoftAP's Wi-Fi network shall be advertised.

  ```c
  #define WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"
  ```

- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

  ```c
  #define WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE"
  ```

- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

- **AP instance related parameters**

- WIFI_AP_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name of the WiSeConnect Access point would be created.

  ```c
  #define WIFI_AP_PROFILE_SSID                   "MY_AP_SSID"
  ```

- WIFI_AP_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key of the WiSeConnect Access point would be created.

  ```c
  #define WIFI_AP_CREDENTIAL                     "MY_AP_PASSPHRASE"
  ```

> Note: 
> 1. In concurrent mode, STA and AP should be configured on the same channel. The STA instance shall first scan for the specified external AP, wherein the channel number of AP is fetched and passed as an argument during SoftAP creation.
> 2. Valid values for CHANNEL_NO are 1 to 11 in 2.4GHz band and 36 to 48 & 149 to 165 in 5GHz. In this example, default configured band is 2.4GHz.

 - Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_ap_profile` configuration structure.

> Note:
> 1. This application is not providing the facility to configure the Access Point’s IP Parameters. Default IP address of the Silicon Labs Access point is **192.168.100.76**
> 2. In concurrent mode, the IP networks of Silicon Labs STA and Silicon Labs Access Point both should be different. Configure Wireless Access Point IP network(Ex: 192.168.0.1) other than Silicon Labs Access point IP network.

#### 4.1.2 Open **sl_wifi_device.h** file. User can also refer the `sl_wifi_default_concurrent_configuration` and can modify/create configurations as per their needs and requirements.
> Note:
> - In `sl_wifi_default_concurrent_configuration`, `oper_mode` must be `SL_SI91X_CONCURRENT_MODE` for this example.

### 4.2 Build the Application

#### - SoC Mode : Build as Concurrent_mode Example
