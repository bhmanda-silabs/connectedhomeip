# WIFI6 MIMO

## 1. Purpose / Scope
This application demonstrates the procedure to measure WLAN UDP/TCP throughput by configuring the SiWx91x in client/server role.
In this application, the SiWx91x connects to a Wi-Fi access point(802 11ax supported ), obtains an IP address, connects to Iperf server/client running on a remote PC and measures Tx/Rx throughput transmitted/received from remote PC.

## 4 Application Build Environment

### 4.1 Configure the Application

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

1. In the Project explorer pane, expand the **resources\defaults** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

- **STA instance related parameters**

   - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which the SiWx91x SoftAP's Wi-Fi network shall be advertised.

     ```c
     #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
     ```

   - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

     ```c 
     #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
     ```

   - Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

2. Configure the following parameters in **app.c** to test throughput app as per requirements

  - **Client/Server IP Settings**
    ```c
    #define SERVER_PORT        <remote_port>      // Remote server port
    #define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS  "192.168.0.100"    // Remote server IP address
    ```

  - **Throughput Measurement Types**

    - The application may be configured to measure throughput using UDP, TCP RX. Choose the measurement type using the `THROUGHPUT_TYPE` macro.

    ```c
    #define THROUGHPUT_TYPE  TCP_TX     // Selects the throughput option; see the following diagrams.
    #define UDP_TX           0			// SiWx91x transmits packets to remote UDP client
    #define UDP_RX           1			// SiWx91x receives packets from remote UDP server
    #define TCP_RX           2			// SiWx91x receives packets from remote TCP server
    ```

  - **Throuhgput Test options**
    ```c
    #define BYTES_TO_SEND     (1 << 29)     // To measure TX throughput with 512MB data transfer
    #define BYTES_TO_RECEIVE  (1 << 20)     // To measure RX throughput with 1MB data transfer
    ```

### 4.2 Build the Application

#### - SoC Mode : Build as wifi6mimo Example

  **![Build as](resources/readme/build_wifi6mimo.png)**
  
#### - NCP Mode

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

#### 4.3.1 Testing Throughput steps at remote system

There are two 'ends' involved when measuring throughput, data is sent between the client end and the server end. By default, the Iperf protocol sends data from the Client to the Server to measure throughput. Depending on the configuration selected, the SiWx91x may be the client or the server. In general, it is advisable to start the server before the client since the client will immediately begin to try to connect to the server to send data. 

The following sections describe how to run the SiWx91x throughput application together with examples for various Iperf configurations that run on the PC.   

## Running the SiWx91x Application
After making any custom configuration changes required, build, download and run the application as described in the [EFx32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/). 


## UDP Tx Throughput
To measure UDP Tx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a UDP client and start a UDP server on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the UDP server on the PC is: 

> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -u -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1`
> 
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -u -p 5001 -i 1`

![Figure: UDP_TX](resources/readme/image217b.png)

## UDP Rx Throughput
To measure UDP Rx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a UDP server and start a UDP client on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the UDP client is: 
	
> `C:\> iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -u -p <Module_Port> -i 1 -b <Bandwidth> -t <time interval in seconds>`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -c 192.168.0.100 -u -p 5001 -i 1 -b 50M -t 30`  

![Figure: UDP_RX](resources/readme/image217a.png)
## TCP Rx Throughput
To measure TCP Rx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as TCP server and start a TCP client on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the TCP client is: 

> `C:\> iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -p <module_PORT> -i 1 -t <time interval in sec>`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -c 192.168.0.100 -p 5001 -i 1 -t 30`  

![Figure: TCP_RX](resources/readme/image217c.png)

The SiWx91x, which is configured as a UDP/TCP server/client, connects to the iperf server/client and sends/receives data for configured intervals. While module is transmitting/receiving the data, application prints the throughput numbers in serial console.
