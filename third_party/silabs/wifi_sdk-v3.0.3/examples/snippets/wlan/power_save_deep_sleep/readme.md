# Power Save Deep Sleep

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to enable power save deep sleep profile with SiWx91x. This application enables power save profile mode 8 and then wait in a scheduler for some time. Once it will come out of delay, it will start running in HIGH performance mode.

Follow the [Getting Started with EFx32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/) guide to setup the hardware connections and Simplicity Studio IDE.


## 3 Project Environment

1. Ensure the SiWx91x loaded with the latest firmware following the [Getting started with a PC](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started). The firmware file is located at `<WiSeConnect3>/connectivity_firmware/`.

2. Ensure the EFx32 and SiWx91x set up is connected to your PC.

3. Ensure the latest Gecko SDK along with the extension WiSeConnect3 is added to Simplicity Studio.

### 3.1 Creating the project

#### 3.1.1 SoC mode

- Connect your board. The Si917 compatible SoC board is **BRD4325A,BRD4325B**.
- Studio should detect your board. Your board will be shown here.

  **![Soc Board detection](resources/readme/soc_board_detection.png)**

- Go to the 'EXAMPLE PROJECT & DEMOS' tab and select Wi-Fi - Powersave Deep Sleep

  **![Power save deep sleep project](resources/readme/powersave_deepsleep_example_soc.png)**

- Give the desired name to your project and cick on **Finish**.

  **![Finish creating project](resources/readme/create_project_soc.png)**

#### 3.1.2 NCP mode

- Connect your board. The supported NCP boards are: **BRD4180A,BRD4280B**
- The EFR32 board will be detected under **Debug Adapters** pane as shown below.

  **![EFR32 Board detection](resources/readme/efr32.png)**

- Go to the 'EXAMPLE PROJECT & DEMOS' tab and select Wi-Fi - NCP Deep-Sleep Powersave

  **![Power save deep sleep project](resources/readme/powersave_deepsleep_example.png)**

 - Give the desired name to your project and cick on **Finish**

### 3.3 Set up for application prints

Before setting up Tera Term, do the following for SoC mode.

**SoC mode**: 
You can use either of the below USB to UART converters for application prints.


1. Set up using USB to UART converter board.

   - Connect Tx (Pin-6) to P27 on WSTK
   - Connect GND (Pin 8 or 10) to GND on WSTK

      ![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_1.png)

2. Set up using USB to UART converter cable.

   - Connect RX (Pin 5) of TTL convertor to P27 on WSTK
   - Connect GND (Pin1) of TTL convertor to GND on WSTK

      ![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_2.png)

**Tera term set up - for NCP and SoC modes**

1. Open the Tera Term tool. 
   - For SoC mode, choose the serial port to which USB to UART converter is connected and click on **OK**. 

     **![](resources/readme/port_selection_soc.png)**

   - For NCP mode, choose the J-Link port and click on **OK**.

     **![](resources/readme/port_selection.png)**

2. Navigate to the Setup → Serial port and update the baud rate to **115200** and click on **OK**.

The serial port is now connected. 


## 4 Application Build Environment

### 4.1 Configure the Application

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

#### 4.1.1 In the Project explorer pane, expand the **resources\defaults** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

- **STA instance related parameters**

- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which the SiWx91x SoftAP's Wi-Fi network shall be advertised.

  ```c
  #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
  ```

- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

  ```c 
  #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
  ```

- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

#### 4.1.2 `sl_wifi_performance_profile_t` in **app.c** can be configured as per requirements to test Deep-Sleep Powersave application.

### 4.2 Build the Application

#### - SoC Mode : Build as powersave_deep_sleep Example

  **![Build as](resources/readme/build_powersave_deep_sleep.png)**

#### - NCP Mode

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

1. Once the build was successful, right click on project and select Debug As → Silicon Labs ARM Program to program the device as shown in below image.

    **![debug_mode_NCP](resources/readme/program_device.png)**

2. As soon as the debug process is completed, the application control branches to the main().

3. Go to the J-link Silicon Labs console pane to observe the debug prints in the Serial 1 tab.

4. Click on the **Resume** icon in the Simplicity Studio IDE toolbar to run the application.

    **![Run](resources/readme/run.png)**
