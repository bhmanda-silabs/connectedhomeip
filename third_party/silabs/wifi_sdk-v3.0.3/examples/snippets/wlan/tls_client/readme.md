- Click 'Create'. The "New Project Wizard" window appears. Click 'Finish'

   **![Create TLS Client project](resources/readme/create_project.png)**


### 3.2 Set up for application prints

#### 3.2.1 SoC mode

  You can use either of the below USB to UART converters for application prints.

1. Set up using USB to UART converter board.

   - Connect Tx (Pin-6) to P27 on WSTK
   - Connect GND (Pin 8 or 10) to GND on WSTK

      ![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_1.png)

2. Set up using USB to UART converter cable.

   - Connect RX (Pin 5) of TTL convertor to P27 on WSTK
   - Connect GND (Pin1) of TTL convertor to GND on WSTK

      ![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_2.png)

**Tera Term set up - for NCP and SoC modes**

1. Open the Tera Term tool.

	- For SoC mode, choose the serial port to which USB to UART converter is connected and click on **OK**. 

      **![UART - SoC](resources/readme/port_selection_soc.png)**

	- For NCP mode, choose the J-Link port and click on **OK**.

## 4 Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.
### 4.1 Configure the application

- The application uses the default configurations as provided in the **default_wifi_ap_profile** in **sl_net_default_valus.h** and user can choose to configure these parameters as needed.

1. In the Project explorer pane, expand the **resources\defaults** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

- **STA instance related parameters**

   - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which the SiWx91x SoftAP's Wi-Fi network shall be advertised.

     ```c
     #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
     ```

   - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

     ```c 
     #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
     ```

   - Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

   2. Configure the following parameters in **app.c** to test tls client app as per requirements

  - **Client/Server IP Settings**
    ```c
    #define SERVER_PORT1        <remote_port>      // Remote server port
    #define SERVER_PORT2        <remote_port>      // Remote server port
    #define SERVER_IP          "192.168.0.100"     // Remote server IP address
    ```

### 4.2 Build the application

-	SoC mode: Build as  TLS Client Example

  **![Build as](resources/readme/build_project_ncp.png)**

-	NCP mode: 

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

- After making any custom configuration changes required, build, download and run the application as below.
- Copy the certificates server-cert and server-key into Openssl/bin folder in the Windows PC2 (Remote PC).
- In Windows PC2 (Remote PC) which is connected to AP, run the Openssl and run two SSL servers by giving the following command
```sh
    > Openssl.exe s_server -accept<SERVER_PORT> -cert <server_certificate_file_path> -key <server_key_file_path> -tls<tls_version>

    Example:
    > openssl.exe s_server -accept 5002 -cert server-cert.pem -key server-key.pem -tls1
```
- After the program gets executed, SiWx91x EVK would be connected to access point having the configuration same as that of in the application and get IP.
- The SiWx91x EVK which is configured as SSL client will connect to remote SSL server and sends number of packets configured in NUMBER_OF_PACKETS.

EVK connects to remote SSL server-1![EVK connects to remote SSL server-1](resources/readme/server1.png)
  
EVK connects to remote SSL server-2![EVK connects to remote SSL server-2](resources/readme/server2.png)
-  Now for debug right click on project and click on Debug As->Silicon Labs ARM Program as shown in below image.
  - SoC
