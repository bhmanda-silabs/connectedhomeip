# BLE Whitelist

## 1. Purpose / Scope

This application is used to add a particular BD-Address to the White List. The device to connect is saved on the white list located in the LL block of the controller.

This enumerates the remote devices that are allowed to communicate with the local device. The White List can restrict which device are allowed to connect to other device.

If it is not, it wont connect. Once the address was saved, the connection with that device is going to be an auto connection establishment procedure. 

This means that the Controller autonomously establishes a connection with the device address that matches the address stored in the While List.

## 2. Prerequisites / Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

### 2.1 Hardware Requirements

## 4 Application Build Environment

### 4.1 Application Configuration

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

**4.1.1** Open `app.c` file,

User must update the below parameters 

- `RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR_TYPE` refers address type of the remote device to connect.  
```
	 #define RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR_TYPE                          LE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS 
```
  - Based on the address of the advertising device, Valid configurations are

    - LE_RANDOM_ADDRESS
    - LE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS
   
   Note:
     Depends on the remote device, address type will be changed.

- `RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR` refers address of the remote device to connect.

	 #define RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR                      "00:1A:7D:DA:71:48"

   `RSI_BLE_WHITELIST_DEV_ADDR1_TYPE`, `RSI_BLE_WHITELIST_DEV_ADDR1_TYPE` refers address of the remote devices to be whitelisted

### 5.3 Run the Application

1. Configure the remote ble device in peripheral mode and put it in advertising mode.

   **Note:** Refer the [Creating New Advertisement Sets](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/5.0/miscellaneous/mobile/efr-connect-mobile-app) for configuring the EFR connect mobile APP as advertiser.

2. After the program gets executed, it adds the configured remote device addresses to the whitelist, and Silicon Labs device tries to connect only with the whitelisted remote device specified in **RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR or RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME** macro and ble_whitelist_addr1 array.

3. Observe that the connection is established between the desired device and Silicon Labs device.

4. Refer the below images for console prints
