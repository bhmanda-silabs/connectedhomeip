## 4. Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

### 4.1 Configure the Application

**4.1.1** Open `app.c` file. 
User must update the below parameters 

- `RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR_TYPE` refers address type of the remote device to connect.
```c
#define RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR_TYPE                          LE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS 
```

Based on address type of remote device, valid configurations are

```c
LE_RANDOM_ADDRESS
LE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS
```

- `RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR` refers address of the remote device to connect.
```c
#define RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR                               "00:1E:7C:25:E9:4D"
```

- `RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME` refers the name of remote device to which Silicon Labs device has to connect.

```c
#define RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME                         "SILABS_DEV" 
```

**Note:** user can configure either RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR or RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME of the remote device.

**Power save configuration**

- By default, The Application is configured without power save.

```c 
#define ENABLE_POWER_SAVE 0
```

- If user wants to run the application in power save, modify the below configuration. 

```c 
#define ENABLE_POWER_SAVE 1 
```

- Following are the event numbers for advertising, connection and disconnection events
```c
#define RSI_APP_EVENT_ADV_REPORT                       0
#define RSI_APP_EVENT_CONNECTED                        1
#define RSI_APP_EVENT_DISCONNECTED                     2
```

**4.1.2** Open `ble_config.h` file and update/modify following macros,
```c
#define RSI_BLE_PWR_INX                                30
#define RSI_BLE_PWR_SAVE_OPTIONS                       BLE_DISABLE_DUTY_CYCLING
```
   **Opermode command parameters**
```c
#define RSI_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                            SL_SI91X_FEAT_ULP_GPIO_BASED_HANDSHAKE | SL_SI91X_FEAT_DEV_TO_HOST_ULP_GPIO_1
#define RSI_TCP_IP_BYPASS                              RSI_DISABLE
#define RSI_TCP_IP_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                     SL_SI91X_TCP_IP_FEAT_DHCPV4_CLIENT
#define RSI_CUSTOM_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                     SL_SI91X_EXT_FEAT_LOW_POWER_MODE | SL_SI91X_EXT_FEAT_XTAL_CLK_ENABLE(2)
#define RSI_EXT_CUSTOM_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                 0
```
**Note:** `ble_config.h` files are already set with desired configuration in respective example folders user need not change for each example.

### 4.5 Running the SiWx91x Application
   
1. Configure the remote BLE device in peripheral mode and put it in advertising mode.For remote mobile ensure that the device is named same as the value mentioned in RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME macro also see to it that Complete local name record is added to advertising data and Scan response data and connectable is ticked in options. 
![](resources/readme/advertiser.png)
   **Note:** Refer the [Creating New Advertisement Sets](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/5.0/miscellaneous/mobile/efr-connect-mobile-app) for configuring the EFR connect mobile APP as advertiser.
2. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs device tries to connect with the remote device specified in `RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR` or `RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME` macro.

3. Observe that the connection is established between the desired device and SiWx91x.  
   **Note:** Examples for BLE peripherals: Bluetooth Dongle, mobile application, TA sensor tag.
4. Refer the below images for console prints
