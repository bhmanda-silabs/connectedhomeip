## Known Issues
  
### SoC
  - The "Browser File Viewer" plugin has issues. It can't render the last image included in the markdown files and observed issues accessing some hyperlinks
  - In SoC mode, M4 power save will work with 384k TA and 320 M4 memory configuration only. It is not supported for "448K TA and 256k M4" and "512k TA and 192k M4" memory configurations
### Network Stack
  
### Wi-Fi
  - WPA3 connection takes 2.5 sec more than WPA2 connection
  - Issue observed with WPA2 Enterprise Connectivity using Microsoft RADIUS Server.
  - power_save_deep_sleep example is not working

### BLE
  - For BLE, dual role scenario issues might occur when connecting as central if the advertising is also going out for the peripheral role. Central connections can be made after the peripheral connections are established and advertising is stopped.
  - LMP timeout BLE disconnection observed with the latest Realme mobile handsets.
  - BLE Powersave + RTOS is not supported in SoC Mode.

## Limitations and Unsupported Features

### Wi-Fi/Network Stack
  - Maximum of 3 SSL connections are supported in WiFi alone mode.
  - TWT is not verified in Coex mode.
  - BGscan is not verified with TWT Feature.
  - No support for DTIM skip feature in power save.

### BLE
  - For BLE, if the connection is established with a small connection interval (less than 15 ms), simultaneous roles (i.e., Central + Scanning and Peripheral + Advertising) are not supported.
  - BLE maximum two concurrent connections are supported, which can be either a connection to two peripheral devices, to one central and one peripheral device or two central devices.
  - BLE Slave latency value is valid up to 32 only.
  
### SoC
  - RTOS support is not available for MCU peripheral drivers. Application-level RTOS support exists.

## Features
- Platform agnostic Wifi, Network APIs.
- FreeRTOS support
- Multi-threaded application development support
- AWS MQTT library support
- BSD and IOT socket application programming interface (API)
- WPA2/WPA3 Personal Support for Station Mode and Enterprise security Support for station Mode.
- Network Application protocol support for 
   Offloaded mode(TCP/IP internal stack) with HTTP/HTTPS, DHCP, MQTT Client, DNS Client.
- TA Power save support and Max PSP, Fast PSP, 11ax TWT profiles are supported
- 11ax and TWT support
- Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) central & peripheral connections are supported
- Wireless firmware upgradation.

## Known Issues
  
### SoC
  - No support for floating point print in Simplicity Studio IDE.
  - The "Browser File Viewer" plugin has issues. It can't render the last image included in the markdown files and observed issues accessing some hyperlinks
  - In SoC mode, M4 power save will work with 384k TA and 320 M4 memory configuration only. It is not supported for "448K TA and 256k M4" and "512k TA and 192k M4" memory configurations
### Network Stack
  - IPv6 support is not available in this release.
  
### Wi-Fi
  - WPA3 connection takes 2.5 sec more than WPA2 connection
  - Issue observed with WPA2 Enterprise Connectivity using Microsoft RADIUS Server.

### BLE
  - For BLE, dual role scenario issues might occur when connecting as central if the advertising is also going out for the peripheral role. Central connections can be made after the peripheral connections are established and advertising is stopped.
  - LMP timeout BLE disconnection observed with the latest Realme mobile handsets.
  - BLE Powersave + RTOS is not supported in SoC Mode.

## Limitations and Unsupported Features

### Wi-Fi/Network Stack
  - Maximum of 3 SSL connections are supported in WiFi alone mode.
  - TWT is not verified in Coex mode.
  - BGscan is not verified with TWT Feature.
  - No support for DTIM skip feature in power save.

### BLE
  - For BLE, if the connection is established with a small connection interval (less than 15 ms), simultaneous roles (i.e., Central + Scanning and Peripheral + Advertising) are not supported.
  - BLE maximum two concurrent connections are supported, which can be either a connection to two peripheral devices, to one central and one peripheral device or two central devices.
  - BLE Slave latency value is valid up to 32 only.
  
### SoC
  - RTOS support is not available for MCU peripheral drivers. Application-level RTOS support exists.
